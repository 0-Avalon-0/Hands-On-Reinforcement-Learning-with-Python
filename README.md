## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
policy_iteration():
 Initialize random policy
 for i in no_of_iterations:
 Q_value = value_function(random_policy)
 new_policy = Maximum state action pair from Q value
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
